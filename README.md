# Simulation of the Hamiltonian Flow for a simple pendulum.
The code draws the trajectory in the phase space by solving Hamilton's equations using Euler's explicit approximation method. The simulation aims to display the creation of energy from thin air due to approximation errors.
### To run the simulation type:
`./sim <path/to/file> <duration in sec> <duration of step in sec> <initial q in rad> <initial p>`

q = 0 is the vertical position of rest.
