Simulation of simple pendulum. The code draws the trajectory in the phase space by solving Hmilton's equations using Euler's explicit approximated method. The simulations aims to display the creation of energy from thin air due to approximation errors.
To run the simulation use

./sim <path/to/file> <duration in s> <duration of step in s> <initial q> <initial p>

q = 0 is the vertical position of rest.
